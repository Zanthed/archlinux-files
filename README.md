Anything I've modified that I don't see done very commonly for good reasons or documented at all anywhere, I'll mention here.

Mostly just hardening garbage Linux and optimizing it for speed.

Feel free to make any issues about any questions or concerns about any modifications. As long as it's constructive and backed up with evidence or is logical, I'll gladly discuss.
